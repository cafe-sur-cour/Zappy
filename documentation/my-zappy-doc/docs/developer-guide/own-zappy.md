# Developer Guide: Create your own zappy project

## Before You Start Coding

### Define Your Project Scope
Before writing any code, clearly define:
- **Game objectives**: What specific Zappy features will you implement?
- **Player capacity**: How many players/teams will your server support?
- **Game mechanics**: Which survival and evolution elements are essential?
- **Timeline**: Set realistic milestones for development phases

### Choose Your Technology Stack
Consider these technology options:

**Server Side:**
- **Language**: C, C++, Python, Node.js, or Go
- **Networking**: TCP sockets, WebSockets, or UDP
- **Architecture**: Single-threaded, multi-threaded, or event-driven

**Client Side:**
- **GUI Framework**: Qt, GTK, Unity, or web-based (HTML5/Canvas)
- **Graphics**: 2D sprites, 3D models, or terminal-based display
- **Platform**: Desktop, mobile, or cross-platform

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Server Development
- Implement the communication protocol
- Create game world management (map, resources, players)
- Handle client connections and commands
- Manage game logic (movement, actions, time units)

### 2. AI Client Development
- Parse server responses and maintain world state
- Implement survival strategies (food gathering, reproduction)
- Create team coordination algorithms
- Handle network communication efficiently

### 3. GUI Client Development
- Design intuitive user interface for game visualization
- Implement real-time game state updates
- Add controls for server connection and game monitoring
- Create responsive graphics rendering

### 4. Testing & Integration
- Test server performance under load
- Validate AI behavior in various scenarios
- Ensure GUI accurately represents game state
- Debug network communication issues

## Quick Start Tips
- Start with a minimal working prototype
- Implement core features before adding complexity
- Test each component independently
- Document your protocol extensions clearly
- Use version control from day one
