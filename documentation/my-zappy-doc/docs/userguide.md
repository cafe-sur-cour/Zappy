## 🏗️ Architecture

The project consists of three main components:

```
📦 Zappy
├── 🖥️  Server      - Core game engine and network management
├── 🎮  GUI Client  - Real-time game visualization interface
└── 🤖  AI Bot      - Intelligent automated players
```

## Prerequisites

   - `zappy_ai` - The AI bot

## How to run the project

To run the project you need to start multiple elements

1 - You need to start the server the servr will handle the messaages from the ai client and the gui. Here is how you start it :
    ```
    ./zappy_server -p <port> -x <width> -y <height> -n <team1> <team2> ... -c <nb_clients> -f <freq>
    ```
    `<port>` = The port on wich to start the server

    `<width>` = The width of the map

    `<height>` = The height of the map

    `<team>` = Here you specify the name of all the team you want to run

    `<nb_clients>` = The number of client each team will hold

    `<freq>` = The frequence by wich the action will be divided, this parameter is not mandatory and will be set at 100 if not specified

2 - If you want a graphical display of what is happening you will need to start the gui :

    ```
    ./zappy_gui -p <port> -h <hostname>
    ```
    `<port>` = The port that the server was started on

    `<hostname>` = The IP on wich the server was started if it was one the same machine `localhost` works

3 - Then you wiil need to start ai clients, one for each team you defined in the server CLI :

    ```
    ./zappy_ai -p <port> -n <team_name> -h <hostname>
    ```
    `<port>` = The port that the server was started on

    `<n>` = The name the ai will joins

    `<hostname>` = The IP on wich the server was started if it was one the same machine `localhost` works
