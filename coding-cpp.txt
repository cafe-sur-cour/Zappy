Fixing Common Coding Style Errors in cpplint

Line too long (whitespace/line_length)

    Error: "Line exceeds 80 characters."
    Fix: Break the line into multiple lines using proper indentation or refactor long expressions.

    Incorrect:
    std::string message = "This is an overly long string that exceeds the character limit, which should be wrapped.";

    Correct:
    std::string message = "This is an overly long string that "
    "exceeds the character limit, which "
    "should be wrapped.";

    Trailing Whitespace (whitespace/end_of_line)

    Error: "Line ends with whitespace."
    Fix: Remove any extra spaces at the end of lines.

    Incorrect:
    int a = 5;

    Correct:
    int a = 5;

Missing Space Around Operators (whitespace/operators)

    Error: "Missing spaces around =, +, -, etc."
    Fix: Add spaces around operators.

    Incorrect:
    int sum=a+b;

    Correct:
    int sum = a + b;

    Incorrect Indentation (whitespace/indent)

    Error: "Code is not properly indented."
    Fix: Use consistent indentation (usually 4 spaces or tabs, depending on the project style guide).

    Incorrect:
    void function() {
        int x = 5;
        x++;
    }

    Correct:
    void function() {
    int x = 5;
    x++;
    }

Braces Formatting (readability/braces)

    Error: "Braces should be on the same line for function declarations."
    Fix: Place opening braces on the same line for function declarations and control statements.

    Incorrect:
    void myFunction()
    {
    // Code
    }

    Correct:
    void myFunction() {
    // Code
    }

    Error: "If an else has a brace on one side, it should have it on both."
    Fix: Ensure both if and else blocks have braces when one of them does.

    Incorrect:
    if (condition) {
    statement;
    } else
    statement;

    Correct:
    if (condition) {
    statement;
    } else {
    statement;
    }

Tab Instead of Spaces (whitespace/tab)

    Error: "Tab found; spaces are preferred."
    Fix: Replace tabs with spaces.

    Incorrect:
    int a = 10;

    Correct:
    int a = 10;

    Extra Blank Lines (whitespace/blank_line)

    Error: "Too many blank lines."
    Fix: Reduce unnecessary blank lines.

    Incorrect:
    int a = 5;

    int b = 10;

    Correct:
    int a = 5;

    int b = 10;

Use of C-Style Cast (readability/casting)

    Error: "Use static_cast, dynamic_cast, or reinterpret_cast instead of C-style casts."
    Fix: Replace C-style casts with C++-style casts.

    Incorrect:
    int num = (int)3.14;

    Correct:
    int num = static_cast(3.14);

Include Order Violation (build/include_order)

    Error: "Headers should be included in the order: C system, C++ system, other libraries, project headers."
    Fix: Order includes correctly.

    Incorrect:
    #include "myheader.hpp"
    #include
    #include

    Correct:
    #include
    #include
    #include "myheader.hpp"

Empty If Statement Body (whitespace/empty_if_body)

    Error: "If statement had no body and no else clause."
    Fix: Ensure that an if statement is either meaningful or removed.

    Incorrect:
    if (condition);
    {
    statement;
    }

    Correct:
    if (condition) {
    statement;
    }
